    Since the Von Neumann Architecture has a single designated space for data and instructions, it can take multiple cycles in order to collect data and instructions for processing. This forces the forces memory to travel through a one-way stream that limits the transfer rate between the memory and the processor. Bottle-neck is what they dub it and it decreases the overall performance of the cpu.
   The Modified Harvard Architecture incorperates both the shared memory of a Von Neumann Architecture and the concept of seperated data and instruction memory. Because of this, the coding for the Architecture can be complex if you ever decide to code instructions into the memory.
   Overall, I think the Modified Harvard Architecture allows for better performance and more control over memory.
